- It will glow green if it is fully charged.
- Expect around 5 hours of play time on the lowest brightness level.
- Do NOT remove the rechargable battery, you can damage the pins. If you *must*- do it carefully.

### Games
- Included is an Everdrive GBA x5 mini & microSD card.
- Navigate menus with the directional pad and A button.
- Up and down selects individual ROMs or folders.
- Left and right moves pages.
- Everything should be in alphabetical order, but if you add new ROMs you should use a tool like [fatsort](https://github.com/dchaid/fatsort) to keep the ordering.
- Press A to launch the ROM.
- Turn the device off and back on to select a new ROM.
- Pressing select brings up the options menu, you can see your recently played games on this screen to easily start back.
- The Everdrives OS is updatable and you can find the latest OS's [here](http://krikzz.com/pub/support/everdrive-gba/OS/).
- If you opt to update the OS, do so carefully. The `GBASYS` folder contains not only the OS but also your save games.
- We ship with the latest OS updates already, so this shouldn't be needed to do out of the box.
